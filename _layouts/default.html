                            <p>
                                Our work with a large energy retailer involved implementing self-service flows in IVR and digital channels using Amazon Connect and AWS. One of the main project goals was to uplift the self-service experience through IVR; and to enable seamless transition of the customer from IVR to digital channel or to an agent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Self-service IVR flows included experiences that made it easier for customers to extend an existing energy plan. Instead of having to call up, go through messaging with an agent and talking about the plan, this was implemented in Connect to the point where almost the whole process was done automatically. The result of this flow was very positive, with customers giving the experience nine out of ten for ease.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In another flow, customers were prompted to update their details, through outbound messaging. Using phone numbers for authentication, as well as account number and date of birth, customers could update their credit card expiry. There was a high level of containment for customers, meaning that many of them preferred to stay within the IVR process rather than speak to an agent.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Smart routing was also implemented in Connect to reduce the number of times a call is transferred between different places in the contact centre. For example, if people are moving house, the smart routing could determine whether the move was a so-called simple or complex move and connect the customer to the right agent.
                            </p>

                        </dt>

                                Outdated technology, ageing infrastructure, poor customer experience and contact centre agent inefficiencies were just some of the challenges that this Australian household name company faced when they decided to migrate their contact centre to Amazon Connect. By doing so, the goal was to create a powerful and simplified experience for customers as well as improve the agents efficiency. They wanted to achieve this by focusing on automating tasks, smarter call routing and more agile and flexible technology.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Amazon Connect together with the power of AWS has decreased average handling time (AHT) for the calls. This has been done by using smarter routing, authenticating the caller identity before the call is connected to an agent and integrating with the CRM system which brings up the customer details. Next best actions are also displayed, allowing agents to offer customers products and services that are relevant to them.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ultimately, Amazon Connect has helped this company reduce call transfers, speed up resolution times and free up agents to handle calls of a higher complexity thus significantly improving not just the overall customer experience but also the efficiency of their contact centre.

                                When the prices for the product you are offering are the same as your competitors, or at least very similar, the only thing to differentiate you is the service and the customer experience. Typically, the customer will choose the provider with the easiest sign-up and the smoothest self-service experience provided in the channel of their choice – be it a website, an app, chat or voice.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The digital platforms of this well-known company were lacking in many ways, not least in the release of new features – from complexity during the development to having to involve a group of people for most of the day to release into production.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Over the 18 months, the company has gone through substantial changes ranging from architecture of the platforms to automation and team culture.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The philosophy behind the change was twofold. Firstly it was to create a customer-first mindset and align the teams with the customer journeys. And secondly to create a flexible cloud-native application architecture based on AWS services. This allows self-service features to be reused across multiple channels – from web, native apps and Amazon Connect-based IVR to voice assistants such as Amazon Alexa and chatbots in the future.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                These changes have allowed the team to radically scale up without decrease in efficiency and to go from one deployment per week to up to 30 or 40 per day. The speed of which they can release new features now isn’t limited to how fast the team can do it, but rather how ready the customers and the organisation is to accept the change.

                                To succeed in fast-paced and competitive software-driven markets, companies must rethink how they design and use applications. Cloud-native application development is an approach to building and updating apps quickly, while improving quality and enhancing safety.

                                Being much more than just a set of tools, DevOps is a culture of cross-functional teams that deliver high business value. AWS is the standout platform providing a set of services, technologies and tools as a foundation for the DevOps culture and enabling organisations to be highly agile and respond to customer needs and market demands.
                            </p>

                                A well-known company we were working with, have embarked on a journey to transform their applications from an “on-premise” architecture to a cloud-native architecture utilising AWS services and establishing a DevOps culture for their development and operations team.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The result was a successful migration of all applications into AWS and highly agile DevOps teams which allowed this company to become faster and more agile in the way they deliver features to their customers. With AWS and DevOps, they were able to reduce the time between the idea stage and the delivery – with design, development and release being achieved quickly, sometimes within hours.
